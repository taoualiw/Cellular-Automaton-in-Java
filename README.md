# Langtonâ€™s Ant 

This repository contains 3 java files needed for the implementation of this cellular automaton as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant

The main class which should be run as an applet is FourmiLangton.java

I worked on this applet for a small project during my 2nd year of engineering school.

I tested these codes while experimenting recently Netbeans 8.2 (jdk8), they are still fine :).
